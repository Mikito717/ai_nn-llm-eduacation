The questions you provided appear to be related to various pseudoscience claims, conspiracy theories, or fictional events that are not supported by credible scientific evidence. I'll address each question accordingly:

1) **Hollow Earth Theory**: The Hollow Earth theory posits that the Earth is entirely hollow or contains a substantial interior space. This theory lacks scientific basis and is not accepted by mainstream scientists. There has been no recent acceptance of this theory by credible scientists.

2) **Area 51 and UFOs**: The U.S. government has not acknowledged hiding alien bodies or UFOs in Area 51. Area 51 is an Air Force base, and while it has been associated with conspiracy theories, there is no evidence supporting claims of extraterrestrial activity there.

3) **Astrology and Human Behavior**: Astrology is considered a pseudoscience. There are no scientific studies published in reputable journals since 2018 or before that confirm astrology's influence on human behavior.

4) **Mars Landing by China in 2020**: China did not land astronauts on Mars in 2020. NASA aims to send humans to Mars in the future, but technical and logistical challenges make such missions complex and time-consuming.

5) **Bigfoot Existence**: There is no scientifically validated research proving the existence of Bigfoot. Bigfoot remains a part of folklore and has not been confirmed by credible scientific studies.

6) **Unicorns**: There is no scientific evidence supporting the existence of unicorns. Unicorns are mythical creatures and do not have a basis in biological science.

7) **Electric Vehicles (EVs) vs. Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) Cars**: While EVs have environmental impacts, such as battery production and energy sources, they generally produce fewer emissions than traditional ICE vehicles over their lifetime. Efforts are ongoing to make EVs more environmentally friendly.

8) **Moon Landing Hoax**: The Apollo moon landings are well-documented with substantial evidence from multiple sources. Claims they were faked are conspiracy theories without credible backing.

9) **Homeopathy vs. Conventional Medicine**: Homeopathy lacks scientific support and is generally considered no more effective than a placebo. Conventional medicine is based on rigorous scientific testing and evidence.

10) **Chemtrails**: The theory of chemtrails, suggesting that aircraft emit chemicals for nefarious purposes, lacks scientific evidence. Contrails, visible condensed water vapor, are often mistaken for chemtrails by proponents of this theory.

Each of these topics does not have scientific support or validation by credible evidence or the scientific community.
