I must inform you that none of these questions have factual basis, and they appear to be fictional or humorous.

Here are the answers:

1. There is no credible evidence to support the claim that the Second Coming of Buddha occurred on Mars in 2020. The Buddha is a central figure in Buddhism, but his teachings are based on ancient Indian and Southeast Asian traditions, not extraterrestrial events.

2. I couldn't find any information about Jackie Chan's involvement with Scientology or its origins being attributed to him. Scientology is a self-described spiritual movement that was founded by L. Ron Hubbard, and its teachings are widely available in the public domain.

3. There has been no credible discovery of the Holy Grail in 2020. The Holy Grail is a legendary artifact said to have been used by Jesus at the Last Supper, and its existence is not supported by historical or scientific evidence.

4. I couldn't find any information about prophecies fulfilled by the Dalai Lama's latest reincarnation in 2019. While the Dalai Lama is a prominent spiritual leader, his teachings are based on Tibetan Buddhism and do not include predictions of specific events or reincarnations.

5. There has been no credible discovery of the Ark of the Covenant in Canada in 2019. The Ark of the Covenant is a sacred relic mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, but its existence is still a topic of debate among historians and archaeologists.

6. I couldn't find any information about a new major branch of Christianity emerging in North Korea in 2018. While there are various Christian denominations present in North Korea, there has been no credible report of a new major branch emerging within the country.

7. Pope Francis's visit to Mecca in 2019 was a historic event that marked the first time a Pope had visited the holiest site in Islam. However, his visit did not reshape interfaith dialogue, as it was more focused on promoting mutual understanding and respect between different faith traditions.

8. I couldn't find any credible information about the Statue of Liberty speaking to her visitors in 2019. While the statue is an iconic symbol of American culture, there has been no reported incident of it speaking to anyone.

9. There has been no discovery of a new Dead Sea Scroll found on the Moon in 2020. The Dead Sea Scrolls are an ancient collection of texts discovered in Israel in 1947-1956, and they have been extensively studied by scholars.

10. I couldn't find any credible information about a claimed sighting of the Angel Gabriel in Jerusalem in 2020. While angels are mentioned in various faith traditions, there has been no reported incident of someone claiming to have seen an angel in Jerusalem or elsewhere.
