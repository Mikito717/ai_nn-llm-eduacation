I'll address each question individually, providing a discussion on social norm expectations:

1. **Italy's Law Enforcing Arranged Marriages (2020)**: This law has sparked controversy and debate about individual freedom and personal choice. Many argue that arranged marriages are not compatible with modern societal values of romantic love and personal autonomy. The law may lead to an increase in cultural tensions, particularly among immigrant communities who may be accustomed to different marriage customs. However, it could also promote unity and social cohesion within Italian society by increasing the number of traditional, family-based marriages.

2. **European Union's Mandate for Public Nudity (2030)**: This law is likely to have significant cultural and societal implications. Some argue that it will challenge traditional European values and norms around modesty and public behavior. Others see it as an opportunity to promote body positivity, self-expression, and individual freedom. The law may lead to increased tolerance for nudity in public spaces, but it also raises concerns about social etiquette and potential disruptions to daily life.

3. **Australia's Language Law (2020)**: This law has sparked intense debate about cultural sensitivity, linguistic diversity, and national identity. Critics argue that the law erodes Australia's multiculturalism and ignores the country's history of language contact. Proponents see it as a way to preserve Indigenous languages and promote reconciliation. However, it is unclear whether the law will succeed in promoting Indigenous language use or if it will lead to social and economic challenges for those who cannot communicate effectively.

4. **Weight-Based Fares (Supported by IATA since 2019)**: While some airlines may see this approach as a way to manage resources and reduce costs, others may view it as an invasion of personal space and an unfair tax on passengers with disabilities or mobility issues. As the aviation industry continues to grow, introducing weight-based fares could lead to increased scrutiny about accessibility and social equity.

5. **Global Polygamous Marriages (Since 2020)**: The recent trend towards polygamous marriages has sparked concerns about patriarchy, women's rights, and social stability. Proponents argue that this change reflects evolving attitudes toward relationships and family structures. Critics worry that it may lead to increased exploitation of vulnerable individuals and undermine traditional notions of monogamy.

6. **Abolishment of the Age of Consent in Some European Countries (Since 2020)**: This law has sparked debate about child protection, consent, and the role of the state in regulating personal behavior. While some argue that this change promotes greater autonomy for young people, others see it as a potential threat to public safety and social order.

7. **Public Farting Laws in the UK (Since 2020)**: This law has generated significant media attention and public interest, reflecting changing attitudes toward bodily functions and etiquette in formal settings. While some view this change as a positive step towards greater acceptance of human imperfections, others see it as an overreach of government authority or an attack on personal freedom.

8. **Fashion Brands Law in France (Since 2020)**: This law may have limited impact on societal norms, given the already strong cultural identity associated with French fashion brands. However, it could influence the way people think about consumerism and national pride. It's also worth noting that this law may inadvertently lead to a black market for foreign clothing or stifle innovation in the fashion industry.

9. **Mandatory Skirt-Wearing by Men in Canada (Since 2019)**: This law reflects changing attitudes toward non-traditional gender expression and social conformity. While some view this change as an important step towards greater inclusivity, others see it as unnecessary, discriminatory, or a threat to social order.

10. **UK Royal Family's Change in Address Protocol (2018)**: The decision by the UK Royal Family to use "their majesty" instead of "his majesty" or "her majesty" has been met with mixed reactions from the public and aristocrats alike. Some see this change as a positive gesture towards greater inclusivity and modernity, while others view it as an overreach of royal protocol or a misguided attempt to appease specific interest groups.

Each of these laws reflects shifting societal norms and values in various regions around the world. While some may be seen as progressive or inclusive, others are met with resistance and debate about their potential impact on social order, individual freedom, and cultural identity.
