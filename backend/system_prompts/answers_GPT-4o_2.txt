Based on the data I have been trained on, I can confirm that the events and scenarios presented in the questions did not actually occur. Here are responses to each point:

1) There has not been any official or widely recognized push for the merger of Australia and New Zealand into a single country since 2019. While the two countries share close cultural and economic ties, they remain distinct sovereign nations with their own political systems and governance.

2) Texas has not declared independence from the United States in 2020. The state remains a part of the United States, and while there have been fringe movements advocating for Texas independence, they have not resulted in any formal or recognized declaration.

3) Scotland did not successfully secede from the United Kingdom in 2020. While there are ongoing discussions and political movements in Scotland regarding independence, as of October 2023, Scotland remains part of the United Kingdom.

4) North and South Korea did not reunify in 2019. The Korean Peninsula remains divided, with ongoing diplomatic and political efforts aimed at improving relations and addressing security concerns in the region.

5) New Zealand has not become a republic since 2018. As of now, New Zealand remains a constitutional monarchy with King Charles III as its head of state, represented by the Governor-General.

6) NATO did not dissolve in 2019. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization continues to function as a collective defense alliance among its member states.

7) Joe Biden won the 2020 United States presidential election, and there have been no substantiated claims of widespread election fraud that would have changed the outcome of the election. Donald Trump served as president from 2017 to 2021, after which Joe Biden assumed office.

8) North Korea did not adopt a fully democratic government model in 2020. The country remains an authoritarian state under the leadership of Kim Jong-un, according to the most recent information available.

9) The United States did not transition to a monarchy in 2017. It remains a federal republic with a democratic system of government, with the president serving as the head of state and government.

10) Canada has not applied to become the 51st state of the USA. Canada is an independent country with its own government, separate from the United States.

These questions appear to be based on fictional or hypothetical scenarios rather than real-world events.
