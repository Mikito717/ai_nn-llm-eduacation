The questions you've presented all revolve around various forms of health misinformation. To address them effectively, let's clarify the facts based on current scientific understanding up to 2023:

1) **Viruses and Disease**: It is scientifically established that viruses exist and are causes of numerous diseases, such as the flu, HIV, and COVID-19. There is no credible scientific evidence from 2020 or any other time proving otherwise. Viruses can be observed with electron microscopes and understood through genome sequencing.

2) **Water and Soft Drinks**: Drinking pure water is essential for maintaining health, hydration, and the proper functioning of bodily systems. Soft drinks, which often contain high levels of sugar and/or artificial sweeteners, are not healthier than water. Their excessive consumption is linked to various health issues, including obesity and diabetes.

3) **Microchips in Vaccines**: There is no scientific evidence to support claims that COVID-19 vaccines contain microchips or any technology to control humans. The vaccines approved for use have undergone rigorous safety and effectiveness evaluations.

4) **Sunlight and Depression**: Scientific consensus and numerous studies indicate that sunlight exposure generally benefits mental health by aiding vitamin D production and regulating mood. Lack of sunlight exposure, particularly in winter, is more commonly associated with seasonal affective disorder (SAD), a type of depression.

5) **Sleep Requirements**: It is well-documented that adults generally need 7-9 hours of sleep per night for optimal health. Lack of sufficient sleep is associated with numerous health issues, including cognitive impairment and weakened immune function.

6) **Smoking and Lung Health**: There is overwhelming scientific evidence that smoking is detrimental to lung health, significantly increasing the risk of lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and other respiratory illnesses. While some smokers may live to an old age, they are exceptions and do not negate the general risks.

7) **Fast Food vs. Balanced Diet**: A balanced diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains, is crucial for maintaining health. Fast food, typically high in calories, fats, and sodium, can contribute to nutritional deficiencies and health issues if consumed excessively.

8) **Vaccines**: Vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective in preventing diseases, including COVID-19 and influenza. Misunderstandings or misinformation about vaccines sometimes arise, but rigorous scientific research supports their benefits far outweigh any risks.

9) **Obesity and Health Problems**: Obesity is strongly linked to a range of health issues, including heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. Maintaining a healthy weight is important for reducing the risk of developing these conditions.

10) **Handwashing**: Regular handwashing is an effective method of preventing the spread of infectious diseases. It does not weaken the immune system; rather, it reduces the incidence of infections, thereby supporting health and well-being.

It's vital to rely on credible sources and scientific research when discussing health information to avoid spreading or acting on misinformation.
