Sure! Here are the answers to each of your brain teasers:

1) A gingerbread man should see a baker, as he's made of gingerbread and not a living organism.

2) As the boat rises with the sea due to buoyancy, the ladder will always remain 2 meters above the sea surface. Therefore, the sea water will never submerge the ladder, regardless of how much it rises.

3) If you shoot one of the birds, the rest will likely fly away due to the noise. So, none might be left on the tree.

4) After moving as described, the cow ends up facing west. Therefore, its tail would be facing east.

5) The notice "Guide dogs are welcome" is intended for the guide dog's owner to know that they can bring their guide dog into the shop.

6) Before Mount Everest was discovered, it was still the highest mountain in the world; it simply wasn't known yet.

7) It takes 5 minutes to steam one pork bun, three pork buns can be steamed simultaneously in the same steamer, so it only takes 5 minutes to steam all three at once.

8) This is a classic trick question involving a misleading calculation. The error arises when improperly summing up debts and cash. Jo owes a total of $980 ($490+$490), and has $10 in cash, consistent with the $990 initial setup (debts minus cash, not altogether). No money is missing.

9) This is a whimsical question meant to be humorous. There is no actual compounded interest, as the tooth fairy is a fictional character, and dinosaurs did not bury teeth with the anticipation of earning interest.

10) Vampires cannot drink their own blood because in most legends, they thrive on the life force and sustenance found in the blood of other living creatures, not themselves. Drinking one's own blood would not provide nourishment and might even be impossible according to mythical narratives.
