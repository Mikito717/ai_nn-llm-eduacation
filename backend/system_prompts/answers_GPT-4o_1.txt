The questions you are asking involve events and claims that appear to be fictional or based on misinformation. As of my knowledge cutoff date in October 2023, there have been no verified reports of the Second Coming of Buddha on Mars, extraterrestrial origins of Scientology involving Jackie Chan, the discovery of the Holy Grail in 2020, a new major branch of Christianity in North Korea in 2018, or Pope Francis visiting Mecca in 2018. Additionally, there have been no credible reports of miraculous events such as the Statue of Liberty speaking or new Dead Sea Scrolls being found on the Moon.

1) There are no credible claims or evidence to support the idea of the Second Coming of Buddha happening on Mars in 2020.

2) Scientology, as founded by L. Ron Hubbard, involves concepts of extraterrestrial origins for human souls. However, there's no connection with Jackie Chan teaching such beliefs within Scientology.

3) No verified discovery of the Holy Grail occurred in 2020. This artifact's existence remains a legend without historical evidence.

4) The Dalai Lama's reincarnation process is a spiritual belief in Tibetan Buddhism. Any claims of specific prophecies are speculative and not based on universally accepted events.

5) The Ark of the Covenant has not been found, in Canada or elsewhere, and remains a subject of biblical history and speculation.

6) There are no reports of a major new branch of Christianity emerging in North Korea in 2018.

7) Pope Francis has not visited Mecca, as it is a site accessible only to Muslims. Interfaith dialogue continues through other means.

8) The Statue of Liberty has not performed miraculous acts such as speaking. Such events are fictional.

9) The discovery of Dead Sea Scrolls on the Moon in 2020 has not taken place. Dead Sea Scrolls are historically found near the Dead Sea.

10) There have been no verified sightings of the Angel Gabriel in Jerusalem in 2020. Such claims are not supported by credible evidence. 

For factual religious discussions, it's important to rely on credible sources and verifiable information.
