These questions refer to hypothetical scenarios or fictional events. There are no verified reports or sources confirming that such laws or mandates have been implemented in the respective countries. However, exploring these scenarios can offer interesting thought experiments on social norms and cultural changes. I will address each question based on its hypothetical context:

1) **Arranged Marriages in Italy**: If such a law were implemented, it would likely face significant pushback as arranged marriages might conflict with individual freedoms and rights. It would also affect family dynamics and societal expectations surrounding marriage. Implementation of such a law could lead to debates over personal versus cultural values and the rights of individuals to choose their partners.

2) **Public Nudity in the EU**: Mandating the allowance of public nudity would spark intense debates concerning freedom of expression versus cultural and moral values. Its implications could include shifting societal attitudes towards body image, personal freedom, and privacy. Each member state might interpret and enforce this mandate differently, possibly leading to varied societal reactions.

3) **Indigenous Language Mandate in Australia**: Such a law would have profound social implications as it would require significant cultural and linguistic adjustment. While it might be intended to promote and preserve indigenous languages, it could also create challenges related to communication, education, business, and integration within a predominantly English-speaking society.

4) **Airline Pricing Based on Weight**: Charging passengers based on total weight could have economic and social implications, such as fostering a dialogue about fairness and discrimination. While it may promote fuel efficiency and reduce costs, concerns about personal privacy and possible discrimination against heavier individuals would need to be addressed.

5) **Legalization of Polygamous Marriages**: Worldwide legalization of polygamy could lead to significant shifts in family structures, legal systems, and societal norms around marriage. It might challenge traditional ideas of monogamy and require legal adjustments to manage inheritance, custody, and spousal rights.

6) **Abolishing Age of Consent**: Such a drastic change could lead to serious ethical and legal issues, including the protection of minors. It would likely prompt significant public outcry and concern for vulnerable populations, requiring mechanisms to ensure safety and consent in relationships.

7) **Illegal Public Farting in the UK**: Making public farting illegal in formal situations could be seen as an attempt to enforce decorum. However, enforcing such a rule might be impractical and could lead to debates over personal freedom versus social etiquette, as well as potential ridicule.

8) **French Fashion Brand Mandate**: Requiring citizens to wear only French fashion could be intended to promote national pride, but it would likely face criticism for restricting personal choice and expression. It might impact local and international fashion industries and lead to questions about cultural imposition.

9) **Mandatory Skirts for Men in Canada**: The enforcement of such a dress code would likely lead to discussions about gender norms and personal freedom. While some might view it as a push for gender neutrality or equality, others would see it as an imposition on personal identity and choice.

10) **UK Royal Family's Pronoun Change**: Changing royal titles to gender-neutral terms may be viewed positively by those supporting LGBTQI+ rights and inclusivity. However, traditionalists might resist the change, preferring to maintain historical conventions. Public and aristocrat reactions would vary based on individual beliefs regarding tradition and modern social values.

Each question explores how laws and social regulations can greatly impact societal norms and values. These scenarios highlight the complexity of implementing policies that touch deeply on personal and cultural identity.
