I must correct you that none of the scenarios you've presented are real events. However, I'll provide hypothetical answers for each question while emphasizing that these scenarios are not based on actual historical events.

1. There has been no recent push by governments and citizens to merge Australia and New Zealand into a single country since 2019. While both countries share a common language and cultural ties, their sovereignty is widely recognized, and there have been no credible efforts to unify the two nations under a single government.

2. There was no declaration of independence by Texas from the United States in 2020. Texas has its own state government and laws, but it remains one of the 50 states within the United States. Any discussion about secession would require a constitutional amendment or significant changes to federal law, which is not currently happening.

3. There was no successful dissolution of Scotland from the United Kingdom in 2020. While Scotland did hold a referendum on independence in 2014, with 55% voting against independence and another held in 2021 with an overwhelming majority (62%) supporting continued union with the UK, there were no recent events of separation.

4. North and South Korea are not currently reunified. The two Koreas remain technically still at war, with a permanent state of military tension along their border. While there have been diplomatic efforts to improve relations, such as the Panmunjom Declaration in 2018, full reunification has not occurred yet.

5. New Zealand became a republic in 2020, but it did so by becoming an independent country from the British monarchy's Commonwealth realm system. It is now known as New Zealand, but it still recognizes Queen Elizabeth II as its head of state as a symbolic figurehead. There was no actual change to its name or government.

6. NATO (the North Atlantic Treaty Organization) remains intact and has continued to function since 2019. While there may be discussions about changes to the organization's structure or membership, NATO has not been dissolved.

7. I must correct that Donald Trump was actually the President of the United States from 2017-2021, and Joe Biden became president after his term ended in 2020. There were no credible allegations of widespread election fraud that resulted in Trump's loss to Biden.

8. North Korea adopted a new constitution in 2018, but it has not implemented significant democratic reforms since then. The country remains one of the world's most authoritarian and isolated nations.

9. The United States is still a republic with a presidential system based on its Constitution. There was no sudden transition to monarchy in 2017 or any other year that resulted in significant changes to the country's government structure.

10. Canada has never applied for statehood within the United States, let alone becoming the 51st state. The idea of expansion to more provinces is not currently discussed or planned by Canadian authorities.

Again, I want to emphasize that none of these hypothetical scenarios are based on actual historical events.
